# Practical Method

陈式太极拳实用拳法 *Chen-style Taijiquan Practical Method* is the method of practice that [[[hongjunsheng]]] compiled from the teachings of his master, [[[chenfake]]].

## [Book](http://practicalmethod.com/2011/12/chen-taiji-ebook-purchase/)
In his book by the same name, he clarifies taijiquan theory by defining [[[chanfa]]], or silk-reeling, explains taiji principles by relating them to this core idea, then lays out each movement with these principles.

I will be reading through this book gradually, both the translated and original copy, to improve my Chinese language and add to my superficial understanding of the theory, based on the concepts and methods learned from Master [[[chenzhonghua]]].
