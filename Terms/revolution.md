# Revolution

## Taijiquan
公转 `gōngzhuàn` is achieved through the coordinated [[[rotation]]] of different segments of the body.
The revolution of the hand is performed in the [[[circles]]].
The analogy is to the Earth revolving around the Sun:  It rotates once every day and revolves once every year.

The two directions of revolution of the hand are called 正旋 `zhèng xuán` and 反旋 `fǎn xuàn`.
