# 缠法 Chán Fǎ

Chan fa is a spiraling method of force generation that is a basic principle of Taijiquan.  It involves the sequential [[[rotation]]] of segments of the body in coordination to produce torque.

According to [[[chenxin]]], chan fa could be classified into as many as 12 different types: forward/retreating, left/right, top/bottom, inward/outward, positive/negative, and big/small:
```
其法有进缠、退缠、左缠、右缠、上缠、下缠、里缠、外缠、顺缠、逆缠、大缠、小缠。
```

## In [[[practicalmethod]]]

[[[hongjunsheng]]] simplified this into two basic types: 顺缠 `shùn chán` and 逆缠 `nì chán`.  They correspond to directions of rotation relative to the central axis of the body, just as clockwise is the direction of rotation relative to the clock face.

* In the torso:
    * Shun is when the torso turns left.
    * Ni is when the torso turns right.
* In the legs:
    * Shun is when the torso turns toward the leg, such that the knee raises.
    * Ni is when the torso turns away from the leg, such that the knee lowers.
* In the hands:
    * Shun is when the thumb turns outward, such that the palm turns upwards.
    * Ni is when the pinky turns outward, such that the palm turns downwards.
