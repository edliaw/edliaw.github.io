# 转关 Zhuǎn Guān

[Turning over of the joint](http://practicalmethod.com/2010/12/zhuan-guan-online-video-trailer/) is a concept in [[practicalmethod]].

* Sometimes abbreviated as just "turning".
* Position: The gaining of the `strategic position` is in the struggle for the `meridian`.
* Joint: The `element of surprise` is in the `turning over of the joint`.
* Modern concept: Paradigm shift. Total change in the way of thinking.

* All normal human movements are circular movements, regardless of whether we train or are aware of it.
  * They manifest as straight lines.
  * Your body cannot move at all. All movements comes from rotating the joints.
  * I.e. putting your hand out in a straight line is created by rotation in the elbow and the shoulder.
* Taijiquan adage: Seek the straight line in the curve.
