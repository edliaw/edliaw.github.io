# Positive Circle

正圈 `zhèng quān`, or positive circle, is a foundational exercise in [[practicalmethod]].

## Notes:

* Begin in half horse stance facing right 45°, with the right hand extended.
* In with elbow:
    * Split between hand and front foot, curving down along the bottom of the egg.
    * The hand to the front kua opens in sequence in an S-curve powered by the front foot to the kua.
    * Torso (shun). Hand (shun). Front leg (ni). Rear leg (shun).
    * It ends with the elbow aligning to the front kua.
* Turn with waist:
    * The torso turns left, bringing the elbow to curve up along the back of the egg.
    * The shoulder sinks, the front kua opens.
    * Split between the elbow and front foot.
    * It ends with the completion of the front kua opening.
* Out with hand:
    * The torso turns right, the hand curves out along the top of the egg.
    * Split between hand and rear foot.
    * The rear kua to the hand opens in sequence in an S-curve powered by the rear kua to the foot.
    * Torso (ni). Hand (ni). Front leg (shun). Rear leg (ni).
