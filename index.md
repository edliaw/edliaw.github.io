# Ed's Notes
![avatar](static/favicon.jpeg){.avatar}

Hi, I'm Edward.  This is a journal of my notes and insights into my practice of Chen-style Taijiquan [[practicalmethod]].
Professionally, I work as a software engineer on bioinformatics applications and data pipelines, which may also be the topic of some of my musings.
