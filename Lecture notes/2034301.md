# Power Hour 10

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2020/08/pm-power-hour-classes/)
### [[jingangdaodui]]
1. In with elbow.
2. Out with hand and rotate to face forward.
3. Close left foot in to face forward.
4. Shift to stand on left foot.  Don't move hands.
5. In with elbow and right foot forward.
6. Lift knee and squeeze hand up.

### Mistakes I'm making
* On point 5, the head should not move.
* Practice standing on left foot and doing this move in front of mirror.
* Then practice transition 4-5.
