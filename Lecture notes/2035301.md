## Additional corrections
### Straight lines
* Head like a flag pole, hands like the flag.  Don’t let the head follow the hands.

* Straight lines in the body, clearly expressed.

* Extend in fetch water, how big?

### Empty
* When you stretch, the inside is empty (the power is on the ends).  If your body has protrusions it’s not empty.
* Emptiness is power.  Like under a bridge.  Load-bearing.

### Grip
* Toes, fingers, stomach muscles and teeth all grip at the same time.  So the power goes to your head.
