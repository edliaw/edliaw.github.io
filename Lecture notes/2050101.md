# Foundations/13 moves class

### General corrections

* In general, moves are not deep enough, too loose.  Don't feel the bottom.
* Not stretched out enough.  Yin-yang distinction and stability comes from having that bottom.
* Torso must feel the floor.
* Not enough intention of power.  e.g. Punch covering hand needs that extra stretch at the end to finish it.

### Power moves - six sealing four closing

* Horizontal egg: Power up in with elbow until you hit your ribs.  Rotate, don't lose the line / move your hand.  The body/shoulder gets under the hand.  Go out straight, along the top of the egg (don't go out with the hand under the shoulder).
* Vertical egg: More vertical than horizontal.  Then two hands push out from the top down.
* Digging analogy:  Like scooping up water with a spoon.  Put the spoon in water.  Turn it to pick up the water.  Lift.  The rotation is like carving out a scoop of jello.
