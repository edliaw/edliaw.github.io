# Dao Shou

Began with practicing moving step [[positivecircle]].  All of us missing the key concept of doing [[daoshou]].

### Examples
* Hold a jar and only turn the jar lid.  The hand is only capable of making a fraction of a turn.  Instead of turning the lid back and forth, we lock the position with the other hand and reset the turning hand position.  One hand doesn't move.

### Switching and locking
* Need to be able to switch.
* After elbow in, turn the waist.  *Lock elbow*.  Hand rotates and leads out.
* Switch side: the elbow can belong to the waist (interacting with the waist) or the front kua (interacting with the hand).
* Swinging back and forth is not doing anything - not advancing.

### More examples
* Like a boat falling over waves.  The wave pushes the boat up, then the boat switches to the other side of the wave and goes over the wave.
* Hand comes in and locks - advanced the kua.
* Causes your opponent to move in space, while you only rotate.
* Chest moves backward (down) as hand goes out.

### Sequencing
* Being able to switch is to have a sequence.  1 2 3.  Another sequence is 3 2 1.
* Walking is a sequence.  Your crotch is the middle, your two feet will switch back and forth.  Bite is your foot locking on the ground.  Can use walking as a reference to understand other moves.
