# GEB Introduction

[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach) is a very large book by Douglas Hofstadter.
Some of the ideas covered in the book are:
- self-reference
- acquired meaning
- logical systems
- recursion
- infinity
- layers of reality
- paradoxes
- strange loops (an idea that ties together many of these concepts)

It relates these ideas to subjects such as music, computer science, mathematics, and art.

## Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 1

### Bach

GEB begins with a story about Bach's composition of a six-voice fugue *Ricercar a 6*.

A fugue is like a more complicated canon.
A canon uses a single theme played against transformations of itself:
- Translation over time
- Scaling of pitch, speed
- Inversion

These are all `isomorphism`s - reversible (information-preserving) transformations.
Music has at least these dimensions, and probably more:
- Scale
- Frequency
- Pitch
- Volume

The last canon he describes is an endlessly rising canon, where 3 voices create a cycle that sounds as though it rises without end.
It's not simply a spiral, but maybe like a [toroidal spiral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noRbR3Fbg2I)?
In taiji, it's like the path power takes in the [[circles]].
He calls this a [[strangeloop]]: where an upwards traversal of the levels in a hierarchical system takes one back to one's starting point.

### Escher

M.C. Escher visualizes strange loops in his drawings, as the viewer is led in a climb through imagined dimensions that loop without reversing.
Across all his drawings, there arises the notion of the tightness of the paradoxical loop: how many discrete steps taken before the loop completes.
Although, there is some ambiguity in how to count steps.
Interestingly, the viewer is also a dimension in the paradox.
