## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2020/08/pm-power-hour-classes/)
Continuation of [[2031302]].

Started class with the fajin exercise posted yesterday.

### [[liufengsibi]]
* Lock front hand on line of the rear forearm.
* Don't move the hands.
* Use the front kua
* Moving step version:
  * Tie the front foot to the hand.

### [[xiexingaobu]]
* Fourth move (Double [[negativecircle]]):
  * Don't move the hands. 
  * Lock a point on both arms that cannot be raised or lowered.  As though there is a hula hoop around your arms that should not be moved.
  * Sinking the kuas and shoulders squeezes out the hands.
  * Don't turn torso.
  * Move is like opening an umbrella.
* Fifth move (Turn around and [[fetchwater]]): 
  * Don't move hands, front hand stays on the line of front hand to rear elbow.
  * Link elbows to the body.
  * Maintain line from front foot to the rear shoulder.
  * Front heel is free to rotate.
  * Use the front kua.
