# Power Hour 7

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2020/08/pm-power-hour-classes/)
[[2033101]] exercises.

### Mistakes I'm making
* Intent on the hand: the hand is anticipating the movement and moving on its own.
  * It has to be dead but solid not loose.
  * Especially when doing it with speed, the hand's gear must be locked into the kua and not pop off on its own.
* Shoulder tensing / locking, preventing the arm from staying on the line.
  * Makes the hand follow the kua.
  * Shoulder needs to match / adjust to kua to make the upper arc.
  * Ratio needs to favor the bottom arc.
* Kua starts out with not enough room / too open already.
  * Sit back and give the kua space to open, otherwise the movement will be too small - everything else has to be relative to that movement.

### Kua drills:
* [[twisttowel]]
* [[jingangdaodui]]
  * When powering up, I tense up my upper arm and move my hand.  All the movement has to be on the kua.
* [[danbian]]
  * In the second move, I didn't have the connection to my elbow. I had to bring the elbow back to the position in [[twisttowel]] and give more room to my kua.
