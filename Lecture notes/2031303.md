# How to Learn Taiji

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2013/01/how-to-learn-practical-method/)
[[hongjunsheng]]'s suggested learning method: 多 `duō` system.

### Watch
* Be totally focused on observing.
* Make the image as accurate as possible, until the hidden details come out.
* *Refrain from acting*.
* Only when you see it, then are you capable of acting it.

### Listen
* Things that may not be demonstratable may be explainable.
* Theories may be explained with more accuracy than actions.
* Write it down. *Don't change the word*.
* If you change it, you may have mutated / misinterpreted the meaning.

### Ask
* When the procedure is followed, the question will be framed in the proper context / perspective.
* Based on what the *teacher did*, not based on *you* or on context you brought in from outside.
* It will be to clarify the teacher's actions and words.

### Try / Experiment
* Trying things out may give you more questions.
* As long as they are in the right framework they are not necessarily wrong.
* If they are not in the right framework they are definitely wrong.

### Think
* Contemplate how everything connects.
* The principles guide you to deeper understanding.

## Summary
* There is a sequence / a procedure to follow.
* Simple procedure but it is impossible for an intelligent being to follow strictly.
* But there is a lot of value of adhering to it as closely as possible.
