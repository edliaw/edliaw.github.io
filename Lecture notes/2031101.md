# Power Hour 1

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2020/08/pm-power-hour-classes/)
Continuation of [[2030501]].

### [[liufengsibi]]
* Use the left hand to define the track that the right hand must stay on.
* Don't let the right shoulder move left.
* Right shoulder and right kua on the axis, right foot supports with another axis between right heel and kua.

### [[danbian]]
* First part, hands as though they are in a tube.
* Hands like peeling the surface off the other forearm.
* Second move (hook hand), don't let right shoulder move left, don't let elbow rise.
* Right hand shoots forward, don't swing it.
* Third move (left hand hand out), split with right foot.

### [[baiheliangchi]]
* Need to contain the structure to hold the potential energy.
* Head must be a lid, cannot go up.
* Elbows must stay in, release through the hands.
* This is true for both moves in this posture.
