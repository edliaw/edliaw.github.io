# Foundations class

* In terms of the form, we have to at the beginning ignore the details and get the overall look right.
* Not fluent enough: When you slow down and work on the details, you start losing the overall shape.

### Double negative circle
* Has the tendency to move the hands toward your torso.  Cannot move your hands.
1. Head pushes the two shoulders open.  Two shoulders push the two elbows open.  The two elbows push two hands open.  Umbrella.
2. Twist your dantian and it comes back.
* Just let the hand drop.  Hand has to go below elbow before you take action.  When hand is higher than elbow it has to naturally drop by gravity to below your elbow before you take action.  Else the sequence is off (it backfires onto yourself).

### Partner drill
* Grab hand, other hand on elbow.  Turn and go down, don’t bend.  Open (front, closer to opponent) kua to drive opponent down.

### Playing with sleeves
* Another name for the move 旱地拔葱. Pulling scallions from the dry ground.  360 rotation, only vertical.  Land on same spot.
