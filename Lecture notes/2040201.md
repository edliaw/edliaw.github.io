# Foundations class

* The rotation is converted into an outgoing stretch.

* When a stretch meets resistance, it causes your body to rotate; and when you haven’t mastered it, it causes your body to move.

* Most people make no change in their life.  Old bottle new wine / old wine new bottle.

* Exactly the same, can vary the timing (like it takes you 3 years to do it).  Actualize it.  So you have a real result, or else it just stays a story.

* Use a physical benchmark.  To recalibrate the body, or else you always think you are doing it when you aren’t.

* In the future, it will be the shoulder, not ready for it yet.

* The method is important.  When we are learning do not create a new topic.  Instructors listen to students for vocabulary - if they don’t use the vocabulary they are not learning.  Have to switch to the teacher’s way of thinking.

* Doesn’t matter if you believe it is right or wrong.  You don’t have to worry about making a fool of yourself, then Master Chen can give you feedback.

* Link of your yilu at least once a month.  Must follow a procedure.
