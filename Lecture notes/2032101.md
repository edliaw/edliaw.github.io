# Recalibration

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2015/01/recalibration/)
### Body and mind are harmonized as one
* The mind thinks; the body does.
* Synchronizing the two processes is a higher level skill.
* In normal (unstressed) circumstances, there are some actions that come natural to us like this:
  * Breathing, blinking, using your mouth, tongue, teeth while eating, whole body coordination while walking.
  * Under stress, even these may not be able to be performed at an optimal level.
* Some learned activities can be practiced to this level:
  * Using a pen to write.
* None of the moves in [[practicalmethod]] are naturally harmonized.  They must all be trained.

### Enter the door
* To enter the door means recalibration.
* E.g. a rifle cannot be used for its purpose unless it has been calibrated.
* The requirement is a matter of "life and death."  Without it you are not ready to learn taijiquan.
* "It is up to the master to accept you into the door, but up to yourself to gain gongfu."
* The master's responsibility is to recalibrate your body for readiness, but after that it is up to you.

### Out with hand, no elbow; in with elbow, no hand
* Entry level knowledge is this adage from GM [[hongjunsheng]]
* Must recalibrate our elbow and hand relationship to adhere to these requirements.
* Then the skill will permeate to the rest of the body and you will have entered the door.
