### Cloth tube training device
* Type of training device.  A jeans leg with beans or something heavy inside.  Used to train so that the beans will get thrown to the other side.
* Inside a tube, elbow shoots out through finger tip.

### Knee elbow exercise
* Elbow comes in, knee goes down.

### Knee exercise
* One knee down one knee up.  Torso as though it is a barrel that you dig under.
* If the bottom moves, the top will drop.  The knee leads.  Otherwise there is residual power on the body.  The body does not exist.
* Two knees on a lever.  The shin is locked in a tube, on the front of the knee and on the back of the heel.  The thigh lengthens, knee goes down without the flesh.
* Knee slides down the wall.  Donâ€™t go down, it goes down because of the knee.
* Put the knee on the wall, it pushes forward but it goes down.  Intention of the knee is forward, the result is downward.
