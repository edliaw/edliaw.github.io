# Training Pointers

* Shoulder often in the way.  Kua needs to be big, everything else small / get out of the way.
* The power move is big on the kua.  The rest is setting up.
* Fold the back - the rear elbow stretch against the foot; add the center rotation to increase the stretch.
* Once the moves are there, need to add power points.  Feet grip into the ground and the core rotates (no hand).  / shoot the hand out, no body.
* Elbow doesnâ€™t straighten. Maintain the rod between the shoulder and hands.
* Heaviness training - do the form as though in water / molasses.  Lots of things blocking you from making the move.
