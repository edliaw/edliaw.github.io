# Kelvin's Tuesday class

### [[jingangdaodui]]
* Keep a bend in the left elbow.  Has a vertical 45 degree orientation (we frequently start with it too low, and run out of room for the next move).  Left side positive circle elbow in.

* Turn right 45 degrees, right toes open out to 45.  Left hand stays forward, left elbow leads.

* Bring left toe in toward middle of right foot, switch to heel.  Shovel out (left foot should point directly forward in line with starting position, e.g. North).  Right foot is still 45 (e.g. NW), right knee should aim up and backward in half horse stance.  Toe aims to nose, heel kicks forward.

* Pull left toe to the ground with ankle locked, bringing the knee forward and the dantian to the center of the two legs.

* Out with right hand against feet, head, and left elbow, until right elbow leads forward.  Right hand ends up at the center of the chest.

* Left leg pulls right side in, with the right elbow still leading.  Right forearm has a 45 degree vertical orientation.

* Left leg drives down, right knee lifts to touch elbow.

* Stretch down through the center to bring the foot and elbow down.  Right hand curves down to the center.  Elbows hang with stretch against the top of the head.  Can place the foot in toe-heel to soften the landing.
