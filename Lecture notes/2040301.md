# Yilu corrections

* Fake part - put it there / set it up.
* Only thing you do is rotation - the power part (Pulling the trigger).
* The result is - physical shape combined with a rotation.

* Core must be totally independent of other body parts.

* In a forward move, never move backward.

* In positive circle hand must be slightly higher than shoulder and much higher than elbow.  Donâ€™t drop arm, has to come from shoulder and kua.  Up and down dimension from pumping kua.
