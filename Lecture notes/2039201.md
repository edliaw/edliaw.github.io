# 折叠 Zhé Dié:  To Fold and Open

### Twisting towel
* Practice semi-automatic rhythm:  fire 3 at once.
* Don't move the hands/arms, pump the kua.

### Six sealing four closing 
* Hands on a line, body folds over to drive hands back and forth on the line.

### Fetching water
* Go to the full stretch, fold the body over.
* The action it is named after:  Pull the water out from a well (standing on the edge of the well, keeping the body upright).
* Looks like starting a lawn mower - a change of the name without changing the meaning.  Have to hold the motor still and pull the cord.
* Make sure the kua fully opens.  Has to go to the other side.  It goes up 45 degrees.

### 折叠 zhé dié
* To fold and open - another way to look at rotations in the body.  We worked on this using the kua.

### Thigh rotation in the third part in the positive circle (hand out)
* The rear kua must turn over but move backward.
* Fighting double heavy: rotate inward but outward move.

### Chinese class
* Wild horse parts its mane was covered.
* Same thing: stretch the two ends but need to find the middle to do the work.
* Body movement in this move is horizontal, but the action is vertical.  Very difficult.
