# Fold functions

A fold (also commonly called `reduce`) processes an input data structure in some order to build up an output value.

Inputs:
* A function to combine the elements of the data structure
* A starting value
* A data structure

For lists, which have two simple directions of ordering, this looks like (right and left):
```
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

foldr + 0 [1..5] = 1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 0))))
```

```
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a

foldl + 0 [1..5] = ((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5
```

Implemented in [terms of each other](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6172004/writing-foldl-using-foldr),
```
foldr f b as = foldl (\g a x -> g (f a x)) id as b

foldl f a bs = foldr (\b g x -> g (f x b)) id bs a
```

### [When to use right and left](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446419/how-do-you-know-when-to-use-fold-left-and-when-to-use-fold-right)
* Depends on the associativity of the function you are folding with
* Foldr is like recursion
* Foldl is like iteration


### Lazy languages e.g. Haskell
* A right fold will pass the intermediate value to
