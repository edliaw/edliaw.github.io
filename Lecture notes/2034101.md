# Power Hour 9

## [Notes](http://practicalmethod.com/2020/08/pm-power-hour-classes/)
Continuation of [[[2032301]]].

### [[[pishenchui]]]
* Hand-elbow-shoulder triangle does not change, only it's angle changes.
* Hand stays out, elbow stays in.
* Rotate kua, rotate don't turn torso.  Shoulder maintains a fixed point.

### [[[yanshouhongchui]]]
* Set the hands facing 45 left.
* Kua opens upward and shoulder opens downward to drive fist out.  Much like the twisting towel kua exercise.
* Hand stays on the line.
* Don't turn elbow out.  Must stay pointing down.
* Left kua must maintain axis.  Don't let it sag and fall back.
